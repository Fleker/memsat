The motherboard is the heart of MemSat, using a Pic24 microcontroller and interfacing with the various subsystems through [our api](/docs/api/). It is powered in part by [Mulhbaier's Embedded Libary](https://gitlab.com/memsat/Embedded-Library) along with custom APIs and interfaces developed by students as part of the C&DH (Command and data handling) subsystem.
